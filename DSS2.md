**Lesions in the Landscape** by *Shona Illingworth* refers to the islands of **St Kilda** as a a landscape haunted by traces of cultural memory; the community of people who lived there although small inhabited the islands for over 2000 years. She also hints at its more contemporary identity as a strategic point in the infrastructure of mapping and tracking technology often for semi-military applications. In her video installation she seems to link this to the forcible relocation of inhabitants in the 1930s; hinting at contemporary technology's control and tracking of cultural *externalised* memory. 

There are more benign uses of this kind of tech and in this workshop we are going to look at some of that and apply and model it in Minecraft. But it's worth remembering that the internet and mobile technology which lets us play games like Minecraft is built on elements of military infrastucture. 


Although GPS, weather and communication satellites track our every move they are also like the **living** externalised 'memory' of our culture.   

Projects like Open Street Map allow people to interact with incredibly detailed surveys of the planet and are quite clearly part of the internet of things and what people call big data. But this data is not only something you can **read**, but can be something we can add to and **write**.

# Mapping

## Exploring Maps
www.openstreetmap.com looks like Google maps, but is actually a map you can contribute to.  It can also hold all sorts of more detail than Google maps do.  Let's have a look.

For example I will show you how easy it is to add information to the **big data** of Open Street Map

1. Open [OpenStreetMap](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/drafts/) and login. You can sign-up for free
1. Zoom in on FACT
1. Clicking the "?" icon on the right hand side will let you find out more detail on anything on the map.  
1. Click on the "Cafe at FACT", that will show you some details of all the things it's found.
1. Click on the "Cafe at FACT" and you'll see that it has some tags, which tell you that it's an amenity of type cafe, that it has wireless Internet access, and that it's wheelchair accessible, among other things.
1. Do the same query, but this time choose the "building" it finds.  You'll see that doesn't give you much detail, just a tag to show that it's a building (that's how the software knows to show it as building, rather than a road, or a field or a postbox or whatever.
1. Find the Walker Art Gallery and see what tags it has.  Then go edit the FACT building to give it the same detail.

We can **query** the data in more detail too, to find things of interest.

1. Go to http://overpass-turbo.eu/
1. Navigate to Liverpool
1. Click on the "Wizard" button
1. This lets us query the underlying map data.  Type "amenity = arts_centre" in the dialog box, then click "build and run query"
1. That will then show you all the parts of the map tagged with amenity where it's set to arts_centre.
1. Clicking the "Data" tab over on the right-hand side will show you the raw data that it's received for that query
1. You'll see that most are of type "node", but if you scroll down you'll find that the Black-E is of type "way".
1. Clicking back to the map, if you then find the Black-E you'll see that it's the outline of the building, whereas The Bluecoat, for example, is just a single point.  Nodes are single points on the map, whereas a "way" is a path - sometimes it's a line (like for a road) and other times it's a polygon area (like for a building)
1. On the left, you'll see some code.  That was generated by the wizard, but we can just edit it by hand.  Try changing arts_centre to post_box.
1. Then click "Run" and it'll find all the post boxes in the area of the map you're looking at and highlight them for you.
1. You can search for anything by modifying the query.  For example, if you zoom out a bit to see more of the NW, and then replace ["amenity"="post_box"] with ["aeroway"]
1. Running that will show you all the airfields

## Making Maps

The [http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Software/Mobile] page on the OpenStreetMap wiki has a good list of software to use to view maps and also record things like GPX traces on your smartphone.  For Android and iPhone, [OsmAnd](http://osmand.net/) is really good.

Editing the Open Street Map data only works for things that are facts, not opinions.  If you want to make a map just to use yourself, or to share with a few people then you'll want something else.

However, we can still use the Open Street Map data as the underlying map, so we don't have to enter all the facts (roads, buildings, etc.) ourselves.

1. Go to http://umap.fluv.io/en/
1. Click on "Create a map"
1. You can then edit the map using the tools on the right, similar to Open Street Map
1. Once you've added places of interest etc you can save it and change the way it looks; I want us to make a map that means something to you or a map of St Kilda and then edit the background to **Watercolour** to make classic looking treasure maps.

You can import the data from http://www.mcqn.com/files/FACT-to-DoES-Liverpool.gpx (either by giving the URL, or if - like today - that doesn't seem to be working, you can copy and paste it in) to show a GPX trace (recorded by OsmAnd) of me walking from FACT down to DoES Liverpool.

## Mapping in Minecraft

I then want us to go into Single Player Mode and revisit the Ordnance Survey Map in Minecraft that I've installed from the [Ordnance Survey Minecraft project](http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/innovate/developers/minecraft-map-britain.html). See if you can recreate some of the Maps you've played with above in the game; Can you make your own mapping system? I like building beacons in the game (3x3 pyramid of diamond blocks with a beacon placed on top of the middle diamond block and making paths in glowstone. Then when you turn the time to night you can easily see the most important data in the game and ignore the rest.

## Satellite Tracking in Minecraft

These days when people release data they need to make it meaningful. You can see in overpass-turbo that when you click on the **data** tab the list of `JSON` data is hard to make sense of; the webpage converts this `JSON` formatted text into a human-readable map that we can make sense of.

`JSON` is a standard for organising lists of data that you can write programmes to `interpret' this into a web page or some kind of meaningful or useful way. People write things called an  **API** that stands for **"Application Programming Interface"** that make this easier and quicker.

We can use the `mcpi` API to send special commands to minecraft which dinnerbone at Mojang made for the Minecraft Raspberry Pi community with Martin O'Hanlon author of **Adventures in Minecraft**. 

Similarly a coder in Portland Oregon in the US wrote an **API** to find out the location of the **International Space Station (ISS)** for any time, a predicter for seeing the ISS by the naked eye and a way of finding out the name and number of humans in space at any one time.

If you visit the Radar station on the StKilda island marked "THEN" you will see some buttons you can interact with by using the sign with a sword. One will give you a read out of the current location of the ISS, and another will build a model of the ISS on the CloudMaker server and transport a player there. 

Finally we can use our web browser to predict where we can see the ISS next with the naked eye. We will do this and then place a marker on a map explaining this in the OS map in Minecraft and on the maps we can make at http://umap.fluv.io.

1. Make another http://umap.fluv.io map
1. Find where you want to see the ISS from.
1. Make a note of the LATITUDE & LONGITUDE in the map address; it's the numbers at the end eg. http://umap.fluv.io/en/map/st-kilda-at-fact_3313#12/ `57.7999` / `-8.5340`
1. Go to the address api.open-notify.org/iss-pass.json?lat=LAT&lon=LON
1. This will give a fail message
1. replace LAT and LON with the numbers from your location in the map
1. Press return
1. It will give a list of timestamps
1. Convert the numbers into **real** dates with http://www.epochconverter.com/
1. There you go; place this on your minecraft and http://umap.fluv.io/ maps and happy space station spotting!


## Using the mcpi API with CloudSwitch.py

We will be doing this in more detail soon but we can make things happen in minecraft with the `mcpi` **API**
 
 * Open a terminal window
 * Type `cd ~/MoTDSS2/mcpi/`  
 * Type `vim CloudSwitch.py` and use the cursor keys to move around; see the vim instructions below but if you look through the code you can change the `beacon()` function to build beacons in the game based on minecraft coordinates.
 * When you've hacked the `beacon` function you can make your switch build or unbuild beacons in the game. You save any changes by typing `:wq` and press return
 * You run your python programme by typing in the terminal `python CloudSwitch.py` and press return
 * Another **Do Something Saturday** workshop will look at the `mcpi` **API** in more detail


####Vim

[Vim](http://vim.rtorr.com/) (a version of Vi) is a text editor that lives pretty much on every server on the internet 

Basically you move with the cursor keys and if you want to type something press `i` and you can type and delete as normal. When you're finished hit escape `esc` and if you want to `write` your changes type `:wq`  

 * `i` - insert text
 * `cursor keys` - move in the text
 * `esc` - stop inserting text
 * `:w` - write your changes
 * `:wq` - write your changes and quit vim
