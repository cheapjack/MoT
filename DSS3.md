Today we are going to learn about the [Internet of Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things).

Soon almost everything will be connected to the internet, you can turn your heating off as soon as your phone leaves your street or alert people that you need help or make sure your gran can keep in touch with her family and friends.
