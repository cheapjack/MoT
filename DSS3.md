## Workshop 4 The Minecraft Of Things Part 2

Today we are going to learn about the [Internet of Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things).

Soon almost everything will be connected to the internet, you can turn your heating off as soon as your phone leaves your street or alert people that you need help or make sure your gran can keep in touch with her family and friends.

The basic principles of the internet of things can be learned in Minecraft: you as a player are a `client` on a minecraft `server` that sends you information; where are you, what you are looking at, and then your client (the game on your computer) interprets that data to let you play the game.

Today we are going to play with some physical switches that trigger building events in the game
