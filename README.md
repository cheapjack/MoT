# MoT (Minecraft Of Things)


###Background

[The Minecraft Of Things](http://minecraftofthings.tumblr.com) sprang from research with FACT, Mark Wright, Adrian McEwen and Paul Harter funded by AHRC for the [CloudMaker](http://www.fact.co.uk/projects/cloudmaker-making-minecraft-real.aspx) project

###Shrimps

It uses the *brilliant* **Shrimped Arduino kits** from [Shrimping.it](http://shrimping.it/blog/) at its core and also features prototype methods for visualising data on onboard LED flashers, in Processing and in Minecraft using a modified version of Martin O'Hanlon's [mcpi API](https://github.com/martinohanlon/mcpi) and the [FACT](http://fact.co.uk) [Minecraft CloudMaker Server](http://mc.fact.co.uk:8123/)
