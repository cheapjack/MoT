## Workshop 1 The Minecraft Of Things

Today we are going to learn about the [Internet of Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things).

Soon almost everything will be connected to the internet, you can turn your heating off as soon as your phone leaves your street or alert people that you need help or make sure your gran can keep in touch with her family and friends.

The basic principles of the internet of things can be learned in Minecraft: you as a player are a `client` on a minecraft `server` that sends you information; where are you, what you are looking at, and then your client (the game on your computer) interprets that data to let you play the game.

Minecraft as you all know as a massive modding culture and we are just part of that today.

We are going to send commands directly to minecraft with a language called pythonand connect it to real physical switches. 

Ordnance Survey have even released a [Map of the UK](http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/innovate/developers/minecraft-map-britain.html) in Minecraft so we are going to explore that and the FACT server, CloudMaker first before we try out the **Minecraft of Things** 

###First Off

 * Explore the FACT world
 * Explore the OS map of Great Britain
 * Find St Kilda
 * Explore St Kilda in FACT
 * Try out our switches

###Basic Tools

####Command Line

Behind every application on your computer is a command line where you can control it without the mouse.

 * `ls` - list where we are and what files we can look at 
 * `cd` - change directory go somewhere; we will stay here: ~/MoT/mcpi but if you get lost just type `cd ~/MoT-master`
 * `vim <file name.py>` - open a python file in vim 
 * `python HelloWorld.py` - runs the file HelloWorld.py to send a message to minecraft

####Vim

[Vim](http://vim.rtorr.com/) (a version of Vi) is a text editor that lives pretty much on every server on the internet 

Basically you move with the cursor keys and if you want to type something press `i` and you can type and delete as normal. When you're finished hit escape `esc` and if you want to `write` your changes type `:wq`  

 * `i` - insert text
 * `cursor keys` - move in the text
 * `esc` - stop inserting text
 * `:w` - write your changes
 * `:wq` - write your changes and quit vim
